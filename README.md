# Bash-Honeypot
Bash Honeypot
This project introduces a Bash-based Honeypot system designed to analyze attacker behaviour on a simulated shell environment. The honeypot listens on a network port using netcat and pretends to act like a Linux terminal. When an intruder attempts to access it, the system logs their IP address, username, password attempts, and every executed command.
